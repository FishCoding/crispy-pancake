## CoronAIrus
This project was made to detect Coronarivus in children based on the symptoms and avoiding unnecessary testing on them.

CoronAIrus has two essential parts:

* A trained ML model that can predict, given a set of symptoms and environmental
 factors, the likelyhood that a pediatric patient has COVID-19.
* A visual real-time inference application to use during diagnosis and model 
exploration, which recalculates the outputs of the neural net in the user's browser while they change parameters.

This project was made for the BitsxlaMarato hackathon 2020.
